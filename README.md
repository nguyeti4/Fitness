The android mobile app we developed is called EqaFit.

This app allows the user to schedule for themselves workouts that are to be done on a certain day. 
In other words, a functionality would be to allow the user to search for workout(s) and filter the workout based on muscle groups.
Then they assign the workout(s) to the current day.

Another functionality would be to display an anatomical diagram on the HomePage. 
For a day that the user has completed a workout, areas of anatomical diagram will be highlighted red based on what muscle groups the workout targets. 

Another functionality is to let the user see all workouts they have done previously.
To do this, there is a Calendar beneath the anatomical diagram.
When the user touches a day on the Calendar they are shown a list of all workouts they've been assigned to that day, and of these workouts the user
will also know what workouts have/have not been done.
